Shivli Agrawal's Projects Repository  

Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a **Computer Science major at Purdue University**, and this repository serves as a collection of various side projects and experiments.  

### 🔒 About My Projects  
Most of my projects are **private**, as they are part of my coursework at Purdue University. These include projects for systems programming, software engineering, and other CS courses, which are bound by academic integrity guidelines.  

However, if you'd like to learn more about my work, check out my website:  
🌐 [shivliagrawal.vercel.app](https://shivliagrawal.vercel.app/)  

Here, you'll find highlights of my academic and personal projects, detailed explanations of my work, and more about my journey as a CS student.

### 🎮 Side Projects  
The public repositories here include smaller side projects, experiments, and fun ideas I’ve worked on outside of school. Feel free to explore, give feedback, and reach out if something catches your eye!
